<i>This Jupyter notebook project has a lot of problem description, so the files are not located in the default branch to hopefully prevent my code from being searchable.</i>

This is a taxi ride duration predictor project for a Data Science class at Korea University. Code is in python using libraries such as pandas, sklearn and numpy.
